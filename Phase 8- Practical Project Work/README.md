## ❓ Viva Q&A

**Q: Student Management System-এর main entities কী?**  
→ `Student`, `Teacher`, `Department`, `Course`, `Enrollment`, `Attendance`, `Result`

**Q: Student এবং Course-এর relationship কী?**  
→ Many-to-Many

**Q: Many-to-Many relationship কীভাবে solve করা হয়েছে?**  
→ `Enrollment` table ব্যবহার করে bridge/junction table হিসেবে

**Q: Department এবং Student relationship কী?**  
→ One-to-Many — একটি Department-এ অনেক Student থাকতে পারে

**Q: Enrollment table কেন প্রয়োজন?**  
→ Student এবং Course-এর Many-to-Many relationship manage করার জন্য

    CategoryID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CategoryName VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Book (
    BookID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Title VARCHAR(100),
    Author VARCHAR(100),

```

---
### Step 3 — Insert Sample Data
```sql
INSERT INTO Category VALUES
(1, 'Programming'),
(2, 'Database'),
(3, 'Networking');

INSERT INTO Book VALUES
(101, 'Database System Concepts', 'Korth', 'McGraw Hill', 2, 10);

INSERT INTO Member VALUES
(1, 'Rahim', 'rahim@gmail.com', '01711111111', 'CSE');

INSERT INTO Issue VALUES
(1, 101, 1, '2026-01-01', '2026-01-15');

-- Fine Example: Returned 5 days late → 5 × 10 = 50 BDT
INSERT INTO Fine VALUES (1, 1, 50.00);
```

---
## 🔎 Sample Queries

### Show All Books
```sql
SELECT * FROM Book;
```

### Show Available Books
```sql
SELECT * FROM Book WHERE CopiesAvailable > 0;
```

### Books by Category (JOIN)
```sql
SELECT b.Title, c.CategoryName
FROM Book b
INNER JOIN Category c ON b.CategoryID = c.CategoryID;
```

### Issued Books Report
```sql
SELECT m.Name, b.Title, i.IssueDate
FROM Issue i
INNER JOIN Member m ON i.MemberID = m.MemberID
INNER JOIN Book b ON i.BookID = b.BookID;
```

### Members Who Borrowed Books
```sql
SELECT m.Name, b.Title
FROM Issue i
INNER JOIN Member m ON i.MemberID = m.MemberID
INNER JOIN Book b ON i.BookID = b.BookID;
```

### Total Books
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalBooks FROM Book;
```

### Total Members
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalMembers FROM Member;
```

### Total Fine Collected
```sql
SELECT SUM(Amount) AS TotalFine FROM Fine;
```

## 📐 Normalization

This schema is normalized up to **3rd Normal Form (3NF)**:

| Normal Form | Rule Applied |
|---|---|
| **1NF** | All attributes contain atomic (indivisible) values |
| **2NF** | No partial dependencies on composite keys |
| **3NF** | No transitive dependencies between non-key attributes |

## ❓ Viva Q&A

**Q: Main entities of this system?**
> `Book`, `Member`, `Librarian`, `Issue`, `ReturnBook`, `Fine`, `Category`

**Q: Book and Category relationship?**
> One-to-Many — one category contains many books

**Q: Member and Issue relationship?**
> One-to-Many — one member can borrow many books

**Q: Issue and ReturnBook relationship?**
> One-to-One — each issue has exactly one return record

**Q: Why is the Fine table used?**
> To store penalty amounts for late book returns

**Q: Fine calculation formula?**
> `Fine = (ReturnDate - DueDate) × 10 BDT`

## 🚀 Future Improvements (Advanced Version)

- [ ] `Author` table — normalize author details
- [ ] `Publisher` table — normalize publisher details
- [ ] `BookCopies` table — track individual copy IDs
- [ ] `Reservation` — reserve books before issuing
- [ ] `Payment` — track fine payments
- [ ] `UserLogin` — authentication for members/librarians
- [ ] `BorrowHistory` — full audit trail

## ⚙️ Setup & Usage

### Step 1 — Create & Use Database
```sql
CREATE DATABASE CGPACalculatorDB;
USE CGPACalculatorDB;
```

### Step 2 — Create Tables
```sql
CREATE TABLE Student (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Department VARCHAR(50),
    Batch VARCHAR(20)
);

CREATE TABLE Semester (
    SemesterID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    SemesterName VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Course (
    CourseID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CourseName VARCHAR(100),
    Credit DECIMAL(3,1)
);

CREATE TABLE Result (
    ResultID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    StudentID INT,
    CourseID INT,
    SemesterID INT,
    LetterGrade VARCHAR(5),
    GradePoint DECIMAL(3,2),
    FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Student(StudentID),
    FOREIGN KEY (CourseID) REFERENCES Course(CourseID),
    FOREIGN KEY (SemesterID) REFERENCES Semester(SemesterID)
);
```

### Step 3 — Insert Sample Data
```sql
INSERT INTO Student VALUES
(2210001, 'Rahim', 'CSE', '57th');

INSERT INTO Semester VALUES
(1, 'Spring 2026');

INSERT INTO Course VALUES
(401, 'Database Systems', 3.0),
(402, 'Operating Systems', 3.0),
(403, 'Computer Networks', 3.0);

INSERT INTO Result VALUES
(1, 2210001, 401, 1, 'A+', 4.00),
(2, 2210001, 402, 1, 'A',  3.75),
(3, 2210001, 403, 1, 'A-', 3.50);
```

## 🧮 GPA & CGPA Calculation

### GPA Formula

$$GPA = \frac{\sum(GradePoint \times Credit)}{\sum Credit}$$

### GPA Example

| Course | Credit | Grade Point | Credit × GP |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Database Systems | 3 | 4.00 | 12.00 |
| Operating Systems | 3 | 3.75 | 11.25 |
| Computer Networks | 3 | 3.50 | 10.50 |
| **Total** | **9** | — | **33.75** |

```
GPA = 33.75 / 9 = 3.75
```

### Difference: GPA vs CGPA

| | GPA | CGPA |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | One semester | All semesters combined |
| Formula | Same weighted average | Same, but across all results |

---
## 🔎 Sample Queries

### GPA for One Semester

AND r.SemesterID = 1;
```

### CGPA (All Semesters)
```sql
SELECT
    SUM(r.GradePoint * c.Credit) / SUM(c.Credit) AS CGPA
FROM Result r

FROM Result r
INNER JOIN Student s ON r.StudentID = s.StudentID
INNER JOIN Course c  ON r.CourseID  = c.CourseID;
```

### Total Courses Completed
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalCourses
FROM Result
WHERE StudentID = 2210001;
```

### Students with CGPA Above 3.50
```sql
SELECT *
FROM StudentCGPA
WHERE CGPA > 3.50;
```

### Highest CGPA
```sql
SELECT TOP 1 *
FROM StudentCGPA
ORDER BY CGPA DESC;
```

---
## 👁️ Views

### CGPA Report View

## 🛡️ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

| Role | Permissions |
|---|---|
| **Admin** | Manage Users, Manage Roles, View Reports, Block Accounts |
| **Teacher** | View Students, Upload Marks, Manage Courses |
| **Student** | View Profile, View Results, Change Password |
| **Customer** | Browse, Purchase, View Order History |

---
## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### ❌ Never Store Plain Text Passwords
```
Plain Text:   123456          ← WRONG
Hashed:       $2b$10$KJHJK... ← CORRECT (Bcrypt)
```

### ✅ Enforce Unique Constraints
```sql
Email    VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
Username VARCHAR(50)  UNIQUE
```

### ✅ Strong Password Policy
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character

### ✅ Account Status Management
| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Active` | User can login normally |
| `Inactive` | Account not yet verified |
| `Blocked` | Admin has restricted access |

---
## 📐 Normalization

## ❓ Viva Q&A

**Q: Password database-এ plain text আকারে store করা উচিত?**
> না — সবসময় hash আকারে store করতে হবে (Bcrypt/SHA-256)

**Q: Password hashing কেন প্রয়োজন?**
> Database leak হলেও original password দেখা যাবে না; hash reverse করা computationally impossible

**Q: LoginHistory table-এর কাজ কী?**
> User-এর login/logout time এবং IP address track করা — security audit ও session management-এর জন্য

**Q: Role table কেন আলাদা রাখা হয়?**
> Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implement করার জন্য; নতুন role add করা সহজ হয়

**Q: Authentication এবং Authorization-এর পার্থক্য?**
> Authentication = User কে verify করা (তুমি কে?) | Authorization = User কী করতে পারবে তা determine করা (তুমি কী করতে পারবে?)

**Q: IDENTITY(1,1) মানে কী?**
> Auto-increment — প্রথম value 1 থেকে শুরু, প্রতিবার 1 করে বাড়বে

**Q: Token-based password reset কীভাবে কাজ করে?**
> Random token generate হয়, DB-তে expiry সহ store হয়, email-এ পাঠানো হয়; user link click করলে token validate করে password reset দেওয়া হয়
