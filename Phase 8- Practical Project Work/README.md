## ❓ Viva Q&A

**Q: Student Management System-এর main entities কী?**  
→ `Student`, `Teacher`, `Department`, `Course`, `Enrollment`, `Attendance`, `Result`

**Q: Student এবং Course-এর relationship কী?**  
→ Many-to-Many

**Q: Many-to-Many relationship কীভাবে solve করা হয়েছে?**  
→ `Enrollment` table ব্যবহার করে bridge/junction table হিসেবে

**Q: Department এবং Student relationship কী?**  
→ One-to-Many — একটি Department-এ অনেক Student থাকতে পারে

**Q: Enrollment table কেন প্রয়োজন?**  
→ Student এবং Course-এর Many-to-Many relationship manage করার জন্য

## 🧮 GPA & CGPA Calculation

### GPA Formula

$$GPA = \frac{\sum(GradePoint \times Credit)}{\sum Credit}$$

### GPA Example

| Course | Credit | Grade Point | Credit × GP |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Database Systems | 3 | 4.00 | 12.00 |
| Operating Systems | 3 | 3.75 | 11.25 |
| Computer Networks | 3 | 3.50 | 10.50 |
| **Total** | **9** | — | **33.75** |

```
GPA = 33.75 / 9 = 3.75
```

### Difference: GPA vs CGPA

| | GPA | CGPA |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | One semester | All semesters combined |
| Formula | Same weighted average | Same, but across all results |

---
## 🔎 Sample Queries

### GPA for One Semester
```sql
SELECT
    SUM(r.GradePoint * c.Credit) / SUM(c.Credit) AS GPA
FROM Result r
INNER JOIN Course c ON r.CourseID = c.CourseID
WHERE r.StudentID = 2210001
AND r.SemesterID = 1;
```

### CGPA (All Semesters)
```sql
SELECT
    SUM(r.GradePoint * c.Credit) / SUM(c.Credit) AS CGPA
FROM Result r
INNER JOIN Course c ON r.CourseID = c.CourseID
WHERE r.StudentID = 2210001;
```

### Full Academic Transcript
```sql
SELECT
    s.Name,
    sem.SemesterName,
    c.CourseName,
    c.Credit,
    r.LetterGrade,
    r.GradePoint
FROM Result r
INNER JOIN Student s   ON r.StudentID  = s.StudentID
INNER JOIN Course c    ON r.CourseID   = c.CourseID
INNER JOIN Semester sem ON r.SemesterID = sem.SemesterID;
```

### Student Result Report
```sql
SELECT
    s.Name,
    c.CourseName,
    r.LetterGrade
FROM Result r
INNER JOIN Student s ON r.StudentID = s.StudentID
INNER JOIN Course c  ON r.CourseID  = c.CourseID;
```

### Total Courses Completed
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalCourses
FROM Result
WHERE StudentID = 2210001;
```

### Students with CGPA Above 3.50
```sql
SELECT *
FROM StudentCGPA
WHERE CGPA > 3.50;
```

### Highest CGPA
```sql
SELECT TOP 1 *
FROM StudentCGPA
ORDER BY CGPA DESC;
```

---
## 👁️ Views

### CGPA Report View
```sql
CREATE VIEW StudentCGPA AS
SELECT
    r.StudentID,
    SUM(r.GradePoint * c.Credit) / SUM(c.Credit) AS CGPA
FROM Result r
INNER JOIN Course c ON r.CourseID = c.CourseID
GROUP BY r.StudentID;
```

Usage:
```sql
SELECT * FROM StudentCGPA;
```

## 📐 Normalization

This schema is normalized up to **3rd Normal Form (3NF)**:

| Normal Form | Rule Applied |
|---|---|
| **1NF** | All attributes contain atomic (indivisible) values |
| **2NF** | No partial dependencies on composite keys |
| **3NF** | No transitive dependencies between non-key attributes |

## ❓ Viva Q&A

**Q: GPA এবং CGPA-এর মধ্যে পার্থক্য কী?**
> GPA = One Semester Result | CGPA = Overall Academic Result across all semesters

**Q: GPA কীভাবে calculate করা হয়?**
> `(Grade Point × Credit)` এর weighted average — `SUM(GP × Credit) / SUM(Credit)`

**Q: Result table-এর purpose কী?**
> Student-এর semester-wise grade information store করা; এটি Student, Course এবং Semester-এর junction table

**Q: Course credit কেন দরকার?**
> Weighted GPA/CGPA calculation-এর জন্য — বেশি credit-এর course বেশি impact রাখে

**Q: Transcript কী?**
> Student-এর complete academic result report — সব semester, course, grade একসাথে

**Q: Result table-এ কতটি Foreign Key আছে?**
> তিনটি — StudentID, CourseID, SemesterID

## 🛡️ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

| Role | Permissions |
|---|---|
| **Admin** | Manage Users, Manage Roles, View Reports, Block Accounts |
| **Teacher** | View Students, Upload Marks, Manage Courses |
| **Student** | View Profile, View Results, Change Password |
| **Customer** | Browse, Purchase, View Order History |

---
## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### ❌ Never Store Plain Text Passwords
```
Plain Text:   123456          ← WRONG
Hashed:       $2b$10$KJHJK... ← CORRECT (Bcrypt)
```

### ✅ Enforce Unique Constraints
```sql
Email    VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
Username VARCHAR(50)  UNIQUE
```

### ✅ Strong Password Policy
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character

### ✅ Account Status Management
| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Active` | User can login normally |
| `Inactive` | Account not yet verified |
| `Blocked` | Admin has restricted access |

## ❓ Viva Q&A

**Q: Password database-এ plain text আকারে store করা উচিত?**
> না — সবসময় hash আকারে store করতে হবে (Bcrypt/SHA-256)

**Q: Password hashing কেন প্রয়োজন?**
> Database leak হলেও original password দেখা যাবে না; hash reverse করা computationally impossible

**Q: LoginHistory table-এর কাজ কী?**
> User-এর login/logout time এবং IP address track করা — security audit ও session management-এর জন্য

**Q: Role table কেন আলাদা রাখা হয়?**
> Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implement করার জন্য; নতুন role add করা সহজ হয়

**Q: Authentication এবং Authorization-এর পার্থক্য?**
> Authentication = User কে verify করা (তুমি কে?) | Authorization = User কী করতে পারবে তা determine করা (তুমি কী করতে পারবে?)

**Q: IDENTITY(1,1) মানে কী?**
> Auto-increment — প্রথম value 1 থেকে শুরু, প্রতিবার 1 করে বাড়বে

**Q: Token-based password reset কীভাবে কাজ করে?**
> Random token generate হয়, DB-তে expiry সহ store হয়, email-এ পাঠানো হয়; user link click করলে token validate করে password reset দেওয়া হয়
